    "This document provides a template that you can elect to fill in or modify for your project report. The sectioning (header structure) is not strict, and you are encouraged to adjust it to suit your project. **If you choose to use this template, please remove all guiding text, including this cell**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of your final report is to provide a thorough overview of your project. It need not be long; quality and clarity is preferred over quantity. Aim for 3-5 pages; if you feel that further material needs to be included, you can add an appendix with supplementary information, tables, and plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "The report should include the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Abstract\n",
    "    + One-paragraph summary of the report contents.\n",
    "* Background\n",
    "    + Adapt your interim report.\n",
    "* Aims\n",
    "    + State the specific questions and approaches you took up.\n",
    "* Data description\n",
    "    + Adapt your interim report.\n",
    "    + Possibly include select results of your exploratory analysis.\n",
    "* Methods \n",
    "    + Description of the methods used in your analysis.\n",
    "* Results\n",
    "    + Present the figures and tables summarizing your analysis.\n",
    "* Discussion\n",
    "    + Highlight your main findings and takeaways.\n",
    "    + Offer further commentary: caveats, further steps, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "These need not be set apart by headers; you are free to determine how to organize your report. For an example, please refer to the adaptation of HW3 into a report provided during week 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Format and appearance \n",
    "\n",
    "* No codes should appear in your report.\n",
    "* All figures and tables should have captions.\n",
    "* Figures should be appropriately sized and labeled.\n",
    "* No text from the template should appear in your report other than headers.\n",
    "* The total length should not exceed 8 pages.\n",

    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Your report will be evaluated based on:\n",
    "* (format) adherence to formatting and appearance guidelines;\n",
    "* (clarity) clarity and thoughtfulness in written voice;\n",
    "* (accuracy) apparent accuracy of quantitative results and technical information;\n",
    "* (applied a PSTAT100 technique) successful use of one or more techniques in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that no credit is tied to the nature of the results; you can earn credit equally well with an analysis that says little as with one that says a lot. **Negative, neutral, or ambiguous results -- analyses that do not produce any particular insight -- are more than acceptable.** If your analyses turn in one of these directions, present them as clearly as possible, and consider speculating in your discussion section about the absence of signficicant/interpretable findings.\n",

    "In order to determined the relationships between of our response and predictors, we will begin by fitting a linear regression model on our data and assess the variable coefficients to determine our significant variables. To do this, we will use the `prop` column as our response, and the rest of the variables as our predictor. We will dummy code our factor variables and turn our data frame into a design matrix. Finally, we will use the scikit-learn package to fit a mutiple linear regression on our design. After determining our significant variables, we will go on to communicate the effects of our significant variables with a few more in-depth visualizations."
